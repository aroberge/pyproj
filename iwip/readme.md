Invent with (idiomatic) Python
==============================

[Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com) is a fantastic
book to help beginners learn programming using Python.  It uses a methodical
approach which strives not to overwhelm beginners with complicated
concepts.

However, one small drawback is that programs are not written in an
idiomatic way, which leads otherwise well-intentioned but ill-informed
commentators on reddit to criticize the book and discourage beginners
from using it.

It is always a good practice to rewrite old programs to make them "better".
The programs included with *Invent with Python* can be made "better" for
people that are familiar with the complete topics covered in
*Invent with Python* as well as more advanced constructs.

**Note**: the modified programs would actually be "worse" as learning tools
for the intended audience of *Invent with Python*.

In this learning path, one has to rewrite the programs to make them "better",
including writing code that follows the conventions mentioned in
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
